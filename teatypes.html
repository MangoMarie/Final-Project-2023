        <h3>Black Tea:</h3>
        <br />
        Black tea is a type of tea made from the Camellia sinensis plant, the
        same type of tea used to make green, oolong, and white tea. It is
        full-bodied, strong, and robust, and it is also one of the most popular
        types of tea consumed around the world. The leaves of black tea are
        oxidized, meaning that the leaves are exposed to air, which causes them
        to turn brown and develop their unique flavor. The longer the oxidation
        process, the darker the tea leaves become. This gives black tea its
        characteristic color, flavor, and aroma. Black tea is known for
        containing high levels of antioxidants, which have been linked to a
        variety of health benefits, including improved heart health, weight
        loss, and improved mental alertness. It is also known for having a high
        caffeine content, making it a great pick-me-up for the morning or
        afternoon. Black tea is available in a variety of flavors, from
        traditional blends to exotic infusions, and can be enjoyed hot or iced.
        Whether you like your tea sweetened or unsweetened, black tea has
        something to offer for everyone.

        <h3>Green Tea:</h3>
        <br />
        Green tea is a type of tea that is made from the leaves of Camellia
        sinensis, a type of plant native to East Asia. It has been used in
        traditional Chinese medicine for centuries and is now widely consumed
        and enjoyed worldwide. Green tea is made by lightly steaming or
        pan-firing the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, then rolling and
        drying them. It has a light, slightly grassy flavor and a slightly
        bitter taste. Compared to other types of tea, green tea contains a
        higher concentration of polyphenols, which are compounds that act as
        antioxidants in the body. Antioxidants help neutralize free radicals,
        which are unstable molecules that can cause damage to cells in the body.
        Studies have shown that green tea may have a variety of health benefits,
        including protecting against heart disease, certain types of cancer, and
        diabetes. It has also been linked to improved mental alertness and
        cognitive function, as well as weight loss. Green tea is available in
        many forms, including loose-leaf, tea bags, and capsules. It can be
        enjoyed hot or cold, and can be flavored with a variety of ingredients,
        such as lemon, ginger, mint, or honey.

        <h3>Oolong Tea:</h3>
        <br />
        Oolong tea is a type of tea that falls somewhere between green tea and
        black tea in terms of flavor and processing. It is made from the leaves
        of the Camellia sinensis plant, the same plant used to make green and
        black tea. The leaves are plucked from the plant and allowed to
        partially oxidize before they are withered, rolled, and dried. The
        oxidation process can last anywhere from a few hours to several days,
        depending on the desired characteristics of the tea. Oolong tea is often
        described as having characteristics of both green and black teas,
        combining the grassy, vegetal notes of green tea with the malty, roasty
        flavors of black tea. The flavor of oolong tea can vary widely depending
        on the type of tea and the length of oxidation, and can range from
        floral and sweet to woodsy and dark. Oolong tea is known for its health
        benefits, including its ability to boost metabolism, aid in weight loss,
        and reduce the risk of heart disease. It is also known for its calming,
        relaxing effects, and is popularly used in traditional Chinese medicine
        for its calming properties.

        <h3>White Tea:</h3>
        <br />
        White tea is a type of tea that is made from the least processed tea
        leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. It has a delicate flavor that is
        typically described as being light and sweet. This type of tea is also
        known for its health benefits, including high levels of antioxidants,
        which can help protect the body from damage caused by free radicals.
        Additionally, white tea may help reduce inflammation and boost the
        immune system. It has also been found to help with weight loss and
        improve skin health. White tea is a popular choice for tea drinkers who
        are looking for a mild and delicate flavor that is still packed with all
        the health benefits of tea.

        <h3>Pu-erh Tea:</h3>
        <br />
        Pu-erh tea is an ancient Chinese tea made from the leaves of Camellia
        sinensis, the same plant used for other tea varieties. It is aged and
        fermented, usually for a period of several months to several years, and
        has a unique earthy flavor and aroma. Pu-erh tea has a long history of
        use in traditional Chinese medicine, and is thought to aid digestion and
        reduce cholesterol. It has a strong, smoky flavor that some describe as
        similar to a fine cigar. Pu-erh tea is typically steeped for three to
        five minutes, and can be steeped multiple times. It is usually served
        hot, but can also be enjoyed as an iced tea. Pu-erh tea is a great way
        to enjoy the benefits of tea without the caffeine. It is also considered
        to be a low calorie beverage that can be enjoyed throughout the day.

        <h3>Herbal Tea:</h3>
        <br />
        Herbal tea is a beverage made from the infusion of various plants,
        herbs, flowers, fruits, and spices. This type of tea is caffeine-free
        and does not come from the Camellia sinensis plant, the bush from which
        black, green, oolong, and white tea are derived. Herbal tea is believed
        to have existed for centuries and its popularity has grown in recent
        years due to its numerous health benefits. It is known for its calming
        effect, as well as its many medicinal uses. Herbal teas can be made from
        many different plants, such as chamomile, peppermint, ginger, lavender,
        fennel, and rosehips. Each of these plants provides different benefits,
        such as helping with digestion, relieving stress, promoting sleep, and
        aiding in weight loss. Many of these teas are also full of antioxidants
        and vitamins, making them a nutritious addition to any diet. Herbal tea
        can be enjoyed both hot and cold and can be served with a variety of
        sweeteners, such as honey and sugar, to enhance the flavor.
