        Tea accessories can range from an assortment of teapots, teacups, and tea infusers, to tea trays, electric kettles, and tea warmers. When you start shopping, it's important to consider what type of tea accessories you need. If you're just starting out with tea, it's best to start with the basics like a teapot, a few cups, and an infuser or strainer. If you prefer loose leaf tea, you'll likely need a teapot with an infuser or basket, and a few tea cups to enjoy your tea in.
