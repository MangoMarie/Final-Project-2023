      Radical self care is an approach to taking care of yourself and your
      well-being with intention, purpose, and commitment. It’s an ongoing
      practice that involves setting boundaries, self-love, and self-care. It’s
      a practice that can be a tool for social justice and personal
      transformation. Radical self-care is about getting to the root causes of
      our suffering, understanding our inner worlds, and healing our
      relationships with ourselves and the world around us. It’s about creating
      space to reflect, to explore, and to nurture ourselves. It’s about
      recognizing our needs, our desires, and our limitations, and honoring
      them. It’s about being honest with ourselves and our feelings, and
      challenging ourselves to grow and learn.

      It’s about taking time to nourish and nurture ourselves in whatever ways
      feel right for us. It’s about understanding and accepting that we are
      always changing and growing. It’s about recognizing our strengths and our
      weaknesses, our successes and our failures. It’s about learning to trust
      our instincts, our intuition, and our decisions. It’s about loving and
      respecting ourselves unconditionally, even when we make mistakes. It’s
      about accepting and embracing all of who we are. Radical self-care is a
      powerful tool for personal growth and transformation. It’s an ongoing
      practice of self-love, self-care, and self-awareness that can help us to
      live our best lives.
